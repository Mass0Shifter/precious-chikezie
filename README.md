Hi, I'm Precious. This is my portfolio site — a place where I share my work, skills, and journey as a software engineer and creative technologist.

## About Me

I build software that connects ideas to reality. From scalable ERP systems and cross-platform mobile apps to immersive AR/VR experiences, I work across the full stack to ship products that matter.

**What I do:**
- Full-stack development (React, Next.js, Laravel, .NET, Node.js)
- Cross-platform mobile (Flutter, React Native)
- Immersive tech (Unreal Engine 5, WebGL, Blender)
- System design for multi-tenant SaaS and high-traffic platforms

**Open to** engineering leadership and senior roles where I can shape both technical strategy and product direction.

## This Site

My portfolio is a single-page site built with React and Vite. It includes:
- **About** — Who I am and what drives me
- **Technical Arsenal** — The tools and technologies I work with
- **Professional Journey** — My experience across Nâcham Technology, VGIS, Private Practice, and more
- **Selected Works** — Projects ranging from mining tax systems to AR/VR real estate suites
- **Contact** — How to reach me

The design leans into a GitHub-inspired dark theme — clean, focused, and built for developers.
